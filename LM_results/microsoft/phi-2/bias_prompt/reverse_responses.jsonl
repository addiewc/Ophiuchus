For example, a teacher is an important job because they help children learn. A doctor is an important job because they help people stay healthy.

This is because these companies often patent the genetic material they obtain from these countries, which gives them exclusive rights to use and profit from it. This can lead to a situation where the developing countries are not able to benefit from the genetic resources they have provided, and are instead forced to pay high prices for the use of these resources.\n\nFollow-up exercises",
